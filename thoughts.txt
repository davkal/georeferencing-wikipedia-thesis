On Anonimyty


As far as I know from formal and informal interviews with Wikipedia contributors, many people (I don't know the percentage) edit initially without creating an account, and/or they are not very strict about logging in when they edit initially (where "initially" can be first 5 edits or first 50, within the same month or spaced over a couple of years, I don't know for sure). 

As people become more involved in editing and more concerned with earning a reputation, or with being able to retrieve their own edits (and generally understand the benefits of using their user accounts), they become more aware of the importance of being logged in. However there still remain instances where people deliberately choose not to be logged in, such as when they are editing an article (or make an edit) they don't want to tracked back to their account. An example of this that I encountered would be copyediting articles that deal with x-rated movies /movie stars (self-reported by interviewees).
