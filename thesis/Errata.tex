\chapter{Errata}

The following mistakes need to be corrected from the version that I submitted as my diploma thesis:

\section{Minor}

\begin{itemize}
  \item In \nameref{ch:apparatus} (ch. \ref{ch:apparatus}), the \nth{4} paragraph should read: ``The application can be accessed over the internet.''
  \item In \nameref{sub:proximitymetrics} (subsec. \ref{sub:proximitymetrics}), in the last paragraph, the mean share of the located text is actually 26.2\%, instead of 23.8\%.
  \item In \nameref{ch:results} (ch. \ref{ch:results}), the first sentence should read: ``This chapter presents the quantitative analysis of a set of articles of political events from the English Wikipedia.''
  \item In \nameref{sub:setpreparation} (subsec. \ref{sub:setpreparation}), the first sentence of the second paragraph should read: ``Then, all articles in \entity{conflictsraw} are tested whether they fulfill the \nameref{sub:articlerequirements} for an analysis.''
  \item In \nameref{sec:characteristics} (sec. \ref{sec:characteristics}), in table \ref{groupmetrics}, the footnote $^{a}$ is missing and should read: ``Excluding bots.''
  \item In \nameref{sec:h5h8} (sec. \ref{sec:h5h8}) and \nameref{sec:h9h10} (sec. \ref{sec:h9h10}), all mentions of \emph{mean} or \term{average} should read ``median'' as they refer to the box plots' middle lines, see figures \ref{fig:group-h56} and \ref{fig:group-h78}.
\end{itemize}


\section{Omissions}

In \nameref{sub:sigdistimpl} (subsec. \ref{sub:sigdistimpl}), listing \ref{signaturedistanceall} presents an algorithm to efficiently calculate the signature distance for all revisions of an article.
It uses an optimization called memoization for which a recursive formula is being used. 
The step of converting the iterative declaration of the signature distance $D(\alpha)$ into a recursive declaration was omitted and is added here for completion.

Using the same notation, let $\alpha$ be an article, $\rho$ be an author, and $\pi$ be a revision.
For a sample of articles $S$ let $A$ be the set all articles in the sample, $P$ be the set of all located authors in the sample, and $\Pi$ the set of all revisions in the sample.
\begin{align*}
A &= \{\alpha : \alpha \in S\} &P &= \{\rho : \rho \in S\} & \Pi &= \{\pi : \pi \in S\}
\end{align*}
Further, let $\eta(\rho,\alpha)$ denote the contribution(s) of author $\rho$ to article $\alpha$.
Then, $N(\alpha)$ are all contribution(s) to article $\alpha$ while $P(\alpha)$ are the author(s) who have made contributions to article $\alpha$:
\begin{align*}
N(\alpha) &= \{\eta(\rho,\alpha) : \rho \in P\} & P(\alpha) &= \{\rho : \rho \in N(\alpha)\}
\end{align*}

In addition, let $\gamma(\pi,\alpha)$ denote whether $\pi$ is a revision of article $\alpha$.
Then, $\Gamma(\alpha)$ are all revisions to article $\alpha$:

\begin{align*}
\Gamma(\alpha) &= \{\gamma(\pi,\alpha) : \pi \in \Pi\}
\end{align*}

Since a contribution creates a revision, the total number $n$ of contributions equals the number of revisions to article $\alpha$:

\begin{align*}
 n = |\Gamma(\alpha)| = |N(\alpha)|
\end{align*}

Let further $\delta(\rho,\alpha)$ be the geodesic distance between author $\rho$ and article $\alpha$.
Additionally, let $\zeta(\pi)$ denote  the author $\rho$ of revision $\pi$ to article $\alpha$.
It follows that the distance of a revision to the article is the same as the distance between the article and that revision's author:

\begin{align*}
\rho &= \zeta(\pi) \, \RA \,   \delta(\zeta(\pi),\alpha) = \delta(\rho,\alpha) 
\end{align*}

In the original signature distance $D(\alpha)$, all contributions by an author were summed up by $\eta(\rho,\alpha)$.
Considering each of these contributions as a single revision $\pi$, the signature distance can also be  expressed as follows:
\begin{align*}
D(\alpha) &= \sum_{\forall \rho \in P(\alpha)} \frac{|\eta(\rho,\alpha)| \cdot \delta(\rho,\alpha)}{|N(\alpha)|} \\
 &=  \sum_{\forall \pi \in \Gamma(\alpha)} \frac{\delta(\zeta(\pi),\alpha)}{|\Gamma(\alpha)|}
 \end{align*}

When expanded, it becomes obvious that the signature distance for $n = |\Gamma(\alpha)|$ revisions contains the signature distance for the previous $n-1$ revisions:
 
\begin{align*}
D(\alpha) &=  \frac{\delta(\zeta(\pi_{1}),\alpha)  + \ldots + \delta(\zeta(\pi_{n-1}),\alpha) + \delta(\zeta(\pi_{n}),\alpha)}{n} \\
 &=  \frac{\delta(\zeta(\pi_{1}),\alpha)  + \ldots + \delta(\zeta(\pi_{n-1}),\alpha)}{n} + \frac{\delta(\zeta(\pi_{n}),\alpha)}{n} \\
 &=  \frac{(\delta(\zeta(\pi_{1}),\alpha)  + \ldots + \delta(\zeta(\pi_{n-1}),\alpha))(n-1)}{n(n-1)} + \frac{\delta(\zeta(\pi_{n}),\alpha)}{n} \\
 &=  \frac{n-1}{n} \cdot \frac{\delta(\zeta(\pi_{1}),\alpha)  + \ldots + \delta(\zeta(\pi_{n-1}),\alpha)}{n-1} + \frac{\delta(\zeta(\pi_{n}),\alpha)}{n} 
\end{align*}

Hence, the signature distance can be restated recursively:

\begin{align}
D(\alpha, \pi_{1}) &= \delta(\zeta(\pi_{1}),\alpha)\label{eqn:sigdistrecursive1}\\
D(\alpha, \pi_{n}) &=  D(\alpha, \pi_{n-1}) \cdot \frac{n-1}{n} + \frac{\delta(\zeta(\pi_{n}),\alpha)}{n} \label{eqn:sigdistrecursive2}
\end{align}

The distance for the first revision, \ref{eqn:sigdistrecursive1}, is the base case for which the signature distance of the article is the distance between the author $\rho$ of revision $\pi_{1}$ and the article $\alpha$.
For subsequent revisions, the signature distance is calculated using the result for the previous revision, \ref{eqn:sigdistrecursive2}.


\section{Quantitative analysis}

A postmortem of the quantitative analysis data, used in \nameref{ch:results} (ch. \ref{ch:results}), revealed that around 15\% of articles were illegitimately rejected\footnote{These articles passed most of the initial \nameref{sub:articlerequirements} (subsec. \ref{sub:articlerequirements}). But then, due to a Toolserver unavailability, the authorship could not be determined and the article was rejected.}.

A re-run of the analysis was done on \dformat{2012}{02}{07}\footnote{The final run for the thesis was done on \dformat{2012}{02}{05}.}.
There, a net\footnote{Two old articles, \term{Homs Bombardment (2012)} and \term{Homs massacre} were merged into \term{February 2012 bombardment of Homs}.} five articles were added to the categories and templates that made up the set \entity{conflictsraw}:

\begin{multicols}{2}\scriptsize
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
1981 General strike in Bielsko-Biała\\
2011-2012 Syrian civil war\\
Castellammarese War\\
February 2012 bombardment of Homs\\
Great Nordic Biker War\\
Masrena
\end{multicols}

The new raw set \entity{confictsraw-b} consists of 746 articles. 
I denote these new articles together with the previously rejected articles as \entity{skipped}.
The resulting set for analysis \entity{conflicts-b} thus contains the articles of \entity{conflicts} plus the articles of \entity{skipped}.
The  articles in \entity{skipped} are:

The new set \entity{conflicts-b} contains 380 articles.
Although bigger in size, the new set's effect on the outcome of the quantitative analysis is negligible.
This is due to the fact that articles are shuffled within the set after retrieval.\footnote{As a result, the run on \entity{conflicts} was done, in effect,  on a random sample.}
The same metrics as in table \ref{groupmetrics} have been measured for \entity{conflicts-b}.
For a comparison, the mean values for both sets are shown in table \ref{groupmetricsE}.

At first glance, the articles in \entity{skipped} seem to contribute especially old articles to \entity{conflicts-b}.
These older articles tend to have a higher number of revisions as well as contributors, raising the mean values for age, revisions, and contributors.

Regarding the hypothesis tests, the results for \entity{conflicts-b} differ only for \hyp{3}, \hyp{9}, and \hyp{10}.
Of the 106 articles qualified for \hyp{3}, 53\% (previously 64\%) were created first in the English Wikipedia.  
A number of languages editions for first article creation were added by \entity{skipped}.
For non-native English authors, Arabic remained the second most popular language edition to publish an article in, \imgref{group-h3b}.

In table \ref{groupmetricsE}, the means of the proximity metrics for all last revisions of the set show a slight decrease.
Therefore, a bigger proportion of content in the articles in \entity{skipped} is local when compared to \entity{conflicts}.  
Figure \ref{fig:group-h910b} shows the distribution of the means of the localness indexes for all articles.
The distribution of means displays slightly lower values than the same distributions for \entity{conflicts}, \imgref{group-h910}.
