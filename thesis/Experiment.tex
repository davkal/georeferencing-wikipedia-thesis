The application described in \nameref{ch:apparatus} will now be fed with articles. 
This chapter will demonstrate results for individual articles and give pointers to how they can be interpreted.
For a quantitative analysis testing the hypotheses on a set of articles, see the next chapter \nameref{ch:results}.

\imgwide{egypt-rev}{Sample run for article \term{2011 Egyptian revolution}}

\section{Example articles}

The experimental runs will be done on the following articles:

\begin{description}
  \item[Egypt-Rev] The article \term{2011 Egyptian revolution} details the protests leading to the overthrow of the government.
  According to the article, this event is still \term{ongoing}.
  \item[Orange-Rev] The \term{Orange Revolution} refers to the events surrounding the flawed Ukrainian presidential election in 2004. 
  This is an article that treats an event that has ended (November 2004 -- January 2005).
  \item[NYC] This article about the biggest city of the United States was included to represent articles that simply treat a place---with a lesser political dimension.
\end{description}

The application analyzes the articles' contributions and presents the results in a report with different sections, \imgref{egypt-rev}.

\section{Analysis}

The general metrics of the three runs are shown in table \ref{examplearticles}.
The rows \emph{Located contributors} show the effectiveness of the georeferencing algorithm using different data sources.
The combined techniques of using the Poor Man's Checkuser database and the parsing of user pages increase the share of located contributors by 20\% to around 60\%.

\subsection{Proximity metrics}

It is also worth comparing the proximity metrics in the lower two groups of rows in table \ref{examplearticles}.
The values from the \emph{cumulative} group are based on the edit counts of all contributions.
For the second group of rows, only contributions were counted that provided text still \term{present in the latest revision}.
Over time, all three articles collected contributions from a number of countries. 
However, during the collective editing process, up to two thirds of them were removed as can be observed in the \abbr{NYC} article. 

The signature distance variant \term{e.surv} can hint which countries' contributions did not survive.
A lower \term{e.surv} value compared to the original signature distance suggests that contributions from distant countries did not survive as well as local contributions.
For the \abbr{NYC} article, the \term{e.surv} distance is less than half the original signature distance, suggesting that a lot of distant contributions were either removed or replaced by local ones.
Conversely, a relatively higher \term{e.surv} value suggests that local contributions did less well---the article \abbr{orange-rev} shows this behavior but the difference is negligible.

More strikingly, comparing the \term{t.surv} distance to the other distance metrics reveals how misleading metrics based on edit count can be.
The \term{t.surv} distance weighs an author's distance to the article's location by the relative amount of text that survived.
A low \term{t.surv} distance means that texts from local contributions dominate the article---despite the other metrics suggesting numerous contributions from more distant countries.
The \abbr{egypt-rev} article shows this behavior where the signature distance shrank by 43\% to 2,705km when weighed by survival of text from located contributions. 
This last qualification is important, however.
If only few of the surviving contributions can be located, the \term{t.surv} distance becomes less representative---for the example articles only around 24\% of the text passages could be located.


\section{Distribution of edit counts vs text survival}

\img{egypt-rev-origins}{Distribution of origins by cumulative edit count for article \abbr{egypt-rev}.}
The change in the distribution of countries can also be observed in the choropleth maps. 
Figure \ref{fig:egypt-rev-origins} shows the map for the cumulative edit count for the article \abbr{egypt-rev}.
The number of edits per country is used to determine the intensity of the shade, e.g. 991 edits could be attributed to the United States. 

\img{egypt-rev-text}{Distribution of origins by text survival for article \abbr{egypt-rev}.}
Figure \ref{fig:egypt-rev-text} shows the map for text survival; the shader value is the number of characters originating from a country, e.g. of all located survived text, 16,655 characters could be attributed to Egypt.

Differences in shade when comparing both maps, can be revealing.
Both the United States and Egypt have a similar cumulative edit count, 991 and 924, respectively.
However, the United States pale in the text survival map as the located text seems to be clearly dominated by Egypt, with 4,267 and 16,655 characters, respectively.
This suggests, the article was equally ``worked on'' by authors from both countries, but contributions from one country were more likely to prevail.
It should be noted again, as only 17\% of the text could be located, no firm conclusions can be drawn.

\img{orange-rev-origins}{Distribution of origins by cumulative edit count for article \abbr{orange-rev}.}
\img{orange-rev-text}{Distribution of origins by text survival for article \abbr{orange-rev}.}

For the article \abbr{orange-rev}, the differences in shading are less noticeable, see figures \ref{fig:orange-rev-origins} and \ref{fig:orange-rev-text}.
However, placed \nth{2} by edit counts, Ukraine ranks \nth{5} in text survival.

The maps for the article \abbr{NYC} are even less suggestive, as the United States dominate both distributions, \imgref{nyc-maps}.

%for all three articles, here are the biggest changes in share of edit count vs share of survived text.

\section{Temporal development}

In the application's section \term{Localness}, a timeline chart displays the evolution of the signature distance and its two variations over time, \imgref{egypt-rev-localness}.
There, the blue line is the original signature distance.
An $x-y-$point on that line reflects the average distance $y$ of all located contributions before the date $x$ weighed by their relative work.

The orange line is the \term{t.surv} signature distance, that weighs the contributions by text survival.
When the orange line is above the blue line, text from distant contributions is overrepresented\footnote{The baseline is the original signature distance (blue line).} in the current revision.
Whenever the orange or red (\term{e.surv}) lines cross the blue line from above, this overrepresentation changes from distant to local.

\imgwide{egypt-rev-localness}{Timeline chart for the signature distance of article \abbr{egypt-rev}.}

As a second visualization of the temporal development, is in the section \term{Evolution}.
There, a motion chart presents the evolution of key metrics over time.
For this, all located contributors were grouped by country and are represented by a bubble. 
The cumulative edit count, the number of survived edits, or the share of survived text can all be plotted against the distance to article or against each other.

\img{egypt-rev-motion-edit}{Evolution of cumulative edit count vs. distance for article \abbr{egypt-rev}.}

By default, the cumulative edit count (y-axis) is plotted again the distance (x-axis), \imgref{egypt-rev-motion-edit}.
An increase in edit count is represented in two ways, a bubble's vertical location as well as the bubble's size.
When the motion chart is played, countries with very active contributors move up faster and grow in size. 
The locality of a bubble and its size make it easy to spot the biggest contributors and their spatial relationship to the article's location, e.g. a big bubble in the upper right represents a distant country with lots of contributions. 

When changing the y-axis to text survival\footnote{The text survival metric is best viewed in a logarithmic scale because the chart axis is scaled according to a country's maximum share. A country's share is usually between 1 and 15\% but  can potentially be 100 \% at some point in time---usually in an early stage of the article, or later as a result of vandalism.}, the bubbles shift to reflect the countries' share of the text in the latest revision.
Here, the biggest move downwards suggests a lot that country's contributions did not survive.

\img{egypt-rev-motion-survival}{Evolution of text survival vs cumulative edit count for article \abbr{egypt-rev}.}

Another interesting plot can be achieved by leaving the y-axis on text survival while setting the x-axis to cumulative edits, \imgref{egypt-rev-motion-survival}.
This plot reflects the efficiency of edits. 
Bubbles in the upper right represent hard earned text survival by lots of edits.
Conversely, a bubble in the lower right suggests contributors of a country producing a lot of edits that do not survive.
%It should be noted that the strong culture bias of the English Wikipedia means that the USA is likely to have a high cumulative edit count, represented by a big bubble.

\section{Hypotheses analysis}

The two political articles \abbr{egypt-rev} and \abbr{orange-rev} were checked for hypothesis support.
The results are in table \ref{exampleresults}.

}

Since  \abbr{egypt-rev} is an article about an event that is still ongoing, hypotheses 7--9 and 11 can not be tested.
