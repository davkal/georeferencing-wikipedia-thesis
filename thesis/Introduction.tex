\titlequote{If you are open to contributions from others, you generally end up with richer, better, more diverse and expert content than if you try to do it alone.\footnote{\fullcite{econ18904124}}}{Alan Rusbridger, editor of \company{The Guardian}}

At the end of January 2011, when a wave of public protest spilled from Tunisia into Egypt, a small group of opposition parties and political activists called for a ``Day of Rage'' via Facebook, a social networking website.
By January 25th their Facebook group had more than 80,000 supporters who drew attention to and helped organize the country-wide protests that followed. 
As people rallied the streets day after day, the Egyptian government first limited access to Twitter, a micro-blogging service, before cutting Egypt off the internet completely on January 28th.\cite{econ18013760, szegypt}

In what came to be known as the Arab Spring, the use of online networks directly influenced the  developing political situation.
While Facebook played a part in organizing the protests, Twitter acted as an information channel during the demonstrations.
As the events unravelled, they were reflected by articles created on Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia.
Updated by the minute, the articles covering the protests formed a well of news reports.\cite{wikiegypt}

Wikipedia's free access, open editing policy, and high quality level---putting it ``head to head''\cite{giles2005internet} with Encyclop√¶dia Britan\-nica---turned it into a hugely popular website\cite{wikipv}.
The server software used for the website, MediaWiki\footurl{http://www.mediawiki.org}{2011}{10}{31}, ensures that the effort to change an article is minimal.
Given an internet connection and a web browser, anyone can add or edit an account of current events in a related article and publish it in a matter of seconds.

This form of news production turns the encyclopedia into a news channel that is constantly updated and corrected by an army of volunteers.
The result is a self-governed news source that lends itself the aura of authority and credibility of a knowledge reference.
At the same time, a technophile public that uses the internet as an efficient means of news acquisition can check facts on Wikipedia, and act upon the consumed information.\cite[p. 424--427]{chadwick2009routledge}
Therefore the collective authorship of such a news medium could have a direct influence on the political decision-making process.
As ordinary people become producers of journalism, the need arises to analyze these contributions. 
This thesis investigates  how Wikipedia is being used during and after political events with a special focus on the geographic origins of contributions to Wikipedia articles treating those events.

Political events are often limited to a country or region. 
This is reflected by the Wikipedia articles covering the Arab Spring that will serve as examples throughout this thesis.
There is an overarching parent article \term{Arab Spring}\footurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring}{2012}{01}{29} as well as single articles covering the revolution in each of the affected countries, e.g. Egypt\footurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Revolution_of_2011}{2011}{10}{31}, Libya\footurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Libyan_uprising}{2011}{10}{31}, and Bahrain\footurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Bahraini_uprising}{2012}{01}{29}.
The events in Libya also exemplify how divided the political actors can be.
While nearly all revolutionaries welcomed the airstrikes, one faction was concerned about foreign meddling and another one just opposed the deployment of ground troops.\cite{econ18290470}

The collective authorship could be equally divided.
Despite Wikipedia's core policy to oblige everyone to write from a \ac{NPOV}\footurl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view}{2011}{12}{08}, people regularly express opinions. 
The collision of opinions in a collectively written article can result in a prolonged series of edits and subsequent reversals by conflicting parties. 
The resulting edit pattern is known as an \term{edit war}.\cite{suh2007us}
These clashes create a potential for further investigation into the geopolitics of article contribution.
Where do the first reports of an event originate?
As later iterations of revisions turn these reports into historical accounts, are these editors from the same country?
And more generally, to what extent is a collection of these articles written by volunteers located at the respective location of the event?

In this thesis I will propose a method to help answer these questions.
First, I will present an improved technique for determining the geographic origin of contributions to an article.
This georeferencing is a key step in the analysis of article revisions.
Then, from the geographic distribution of contributors, local and distant participation will be determined for individual articles.
I will also present two variations of a proximity metric that will allow to measure whether local contributions are more likely to prevail over time. 
These metrics will also be applied in a quantitative analysis of a group or political articles.

\todo{
PENDING analysis: 
 results show that for political event articles,
 majority is not created by locals
 local contributions are more likely to stick and their text more likely to prevail.

\section{Structure}

The chapter \nameref{ch:foundation} provides background information about \nameref{sec:wikipedia}, article editing (\nameref{sec:contribution}), and the application of geographic data (\nameref{sec:georeference}).
The first part ends with the \nameref{ch:hypotheses} where I propose the research questions that this thesis hopes to answer.

In \nameref{ch:apparatus} I will describe the data sources and tools that I used in the development of a web application to perform the revision analysis. 
The chapter details the improved user-locating algorithm (\nameref{sub:locatingusers}) as well as the variations of the proximity metrics (\nameref{sub:sigdist}).
In \nameref{ch:experiment}, I will present the results of an analysis for a few example articles.
There, I will describe how the application's various types of visualization can be used to interpret the results.

Finally, in \nameref{ch:results} I will define the data set for the quantitive analysis and present the results of the application run.
Their feasibility as well as the method's limitations will be discussed in \nameref{ch:conclusion}.
