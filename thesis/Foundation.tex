Wikipedia is a phenomenon that has attracted researchers across all fields, notably computer science and sociology, who have written over 1,000 reports on the subject.\cite{nielsen2011wikipedia}
These roughly fall into three categories: 
\begin{description}
\item[Content production] Covering all aspects of voluntary production such as motivation, collaboration, coverage and bias, quality and vandalism, actuality and geography.
\item[Information use] Treating how the resulting corpus is being used, e.g. citing in research, use in court, trend-spotting, thesaurus construction or categorization.
\item[Improvement] These are studies concerned with the improvement of both the software used by Wikipedia and the content, e.g. automatic linking, bots, improved editors as well as quality and trust indicators. 
\end{description}

This thesis falls into the first category as it examines the geography of article contributions that will become part of the Wikipedia's corpus.
After a short overview of Wikipedia from a user's perspective, I will introduce its model of collective authorship and present prior research of concerning location and geography. 

\section{Wikipedia}\label{sec:wikipedia}

Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia with editions in over 260 languages.
Counting 3.6 million articles, the English version is by far the biggest.
However, other language editions differ sharply in size and usage.\cite{wikistats}
If articles covering the same topic exist in other language editions, these are connected by interwiki links.

\todo{Image: graphic of article UI}

Anyone with a browser and internet access can edit Wikipedia's articles\footnote{Some articles can be locked because of sustained vandalism or content disputes.\cite{wpprotectionpolicy}}.
In collaboration, people all over the world contribute and improve the content. 
Each edit creates a new revision of the article and is stored in the revision history.
Naturally, each article available today started from an empty page and is the result of a succession of edits.

In the revision history each entry consists of the text change, the date of submission, the user and an optional comment explaining the change.
Each revision can not only be examined by other users and but also reverted.
To minimize the potential for \term{edit wars}\cite{suh2007us} Wikipedia urges its users to discuss controversial topics on the article's talk page.

\todo{Image: revision history}

Contributions to an article can be done anonymously or as a registered user.
A registered user gains privileges like the ability to create articles or the use of the social network features in Wikipedia.
With the initial registration a \emph{user page} is created where the user is allowed to publish a profile and interact with other registered users.\cite{wikiwhyaccount}


\section{Contributions}\label{sec:contribution}

Wikipedia's articles are continuously edited by its users.
The nature of an edit can range from simple spelling or grammar correction, over improving the content of a sentence to writing or removing of paragraphs or even whole articles. 
This collective authorship makes it difficult to determine an individual author's contributions, in other words, it is not easy to tell who wrote what.

Research in this area is mostly motivated by finding ways to assign trust to individual authors.
This is based on the assumption that trusted authors consistently produce high quality contributions that outlive contributions of lower quality.
\textcite{kramer2008wiki} devised a method to assign trust to the authors of an article by examining the wealth of information contained in the article's revision history.
They looked at an article as being a set of phrases.
The author who first wrote a sentence gets the credit for that phrase and will gain trust if it survives future edits.\footnote{\textcite{kramer2008wiki} define a sentence as an n-gram---a sequence of n words---and use a sliding window model to follow it across revisions to prevent simple rearrangements of text from counting as a new sentence.}

A similar approach of calculating the longevity of text chunks was followed by \textcite{adler2007content}.
They adapted standard text-diff algorithms to the peculiarities of the wiki revision system, e.g. keeping track of text chunks that were removed at one point and then reinserted in later revisions.
Based on these algorithms a reputation system was implemented by \textcite{adler2008assigning} which offers an API\footurl{http://www.wikitrust.net/vandalism-api} that can annotate a Wikipedia article.
The annotated text is the result of splitting the original text into chunks and attributing them with their respective authors, the number of the revision where the chunk was added and a trust value for the author.\footnote{\citeauthor{adler2008assigning} also released a Firefox add-on that highlights untrustworthy passages when viewing Wikipedia articles: \url{https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wikitrust/}.}

    \\ He's more about the how, I'm about the where. Key findings:
    \item ''I find that as a group, anonymous contributors write about fewer places than registered contributors, despite outnumbering them five-to-one.'' \cite{hardy2011volunteered}
    \item ''I find that anonymous contributors are more likely to write about
nearby places, and that the geographic effects fit an exponential distance decay
function.'' \cite{hardy2011volunteered}
    \item ''Combined approaches (i.e., where quantitative spatial analysis models
are calibrated with surveyed locations) may prove useful.''  \cite[p. 85]{hardy2011volunteered}

\end{todos}

Zur Bestimmung der Herkunft eines Autors bietet Wikipedia zwei direkte Ansätze: 
Für jeden Beitrag eines nicht registrierten Benutzers wird die IP-Adresse gespeichert, über die er Zugang zum Internet erlangt hat. 
Die registrierten Nutzer können jedoch auf ihrer \emph{user page} Informationen über ihre Person entweder als Freitext oder strukturiert in \emph{user boxes} veröffentlichen.

Ein zusätzlicher, indirekter Ansatz für die Bestimmung der Herkunft eines Nutzers wird von Lieberman in \emph{You are where you edit: Locating Wikipedia users through edit histories}\cite{lieberman2009you} beschrieben.
Er basiert auf der Annahme, dass ein Nutzer mit Vorliebe an Artikeln über Orte in seiner geographischen Nähe mitarbeitet. 
Diese Artikel sind in der Regel mit geographischen Koordinaten versehen und erlauben so eine sehr grobe Bestimmung des Aufenthaltsortes und dessen Visualisierung auf einer Landkarte.
