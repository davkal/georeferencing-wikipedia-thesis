	Abstract = {The rapid globalization of Wikipedia is generating a parallel, multi-lingual corpus of unprecedented scale. Pages for the same topic in many different languages emerge both as a result of manual translation and independent development. Unfortunately, these pages may appear at different times, vary in size, scope, and quality. Furthermore, differential growth rates cause the conceptual mapping between articles in different languages to be both complex and dynamic. These disparities provide the opportunity for a powerful form of information arbitrage-- leveraging articles in one or more languages to improve the content in another. Analyzing four large language domains (English, Spanish, French, and German), we present Ziggurat, an automated system for aligning Wikipedia infoboxes, creating new infoboxes as necessary, filling in missing information, and detecting discrepancies between parallel pages. Our method uses self-supervised learning and our experiments demonstrate the method's feasibility, even in the absence of dictionaries.},

	Abstract = {Wikipedia has been a resounding success story as a collaborative system with a low cost of online participation. However, it is an open question whether the success of Wikipedia results from a ``wisdom of crowds'' type of effect in which a large number of people each make a small number of edits, or whether it is driven by a core group of ``elite'' users who do the lion's share of the work. In this study we examined how the influence of ``elite'' vs. ``common'' users changed over time in Wikipedia. The results suggest that although Wikipedia was driven by the influence of ``elite'' users early on, more recently there has been a dramatic shift in workload to the ``common'' user. We also show the same shift in del.icio.us, a very different type of social collaborative knowledge system. We discuss how these results mirror the dynamics found in more traditional social collectives, and how they can influence the design of new collaborative knowledge systems.},

	Abstract = {This study explores language's fragmenting effect on user- generated content by examining the diversity of knowledge representations across 25 different Wikipedia language editions. This diversity is measured at two levels: the concepts that are included in each edition and the ways in which these concepts are described. We demonstrate that the diversity present is greater than has been presumed in the literature and has a significant influence on applications that use Wikipedia as a source of world knowledge. We close by explicating how knowledge diversity can be beneficially leveraged to create ``culturally-aware applications'' and ``hyperlingual applications''.},

	Abstract = {The Internet has fostered an unconventional and powerful style of collaboration: ``wiki'' web sites, where every visitor has the power to become an editor. In this paper we investigate the dynamics of Wikipedia, a prominent, thriving wiki. We make three contributions. First, we introduce a new exploratory data analysis tool, the history flow visualization, which is effective in revealing patterns within the wiki context and which we believe will be useful in other collaborative situations as well. Second, we discuss several collaboration patterns highlighted by this visualization tool and corroborate them with statistical analysis. Third, we discuss the implications of these patterns for the design and governance of online collaborative social spaces. We focus on the relevance of authorship, the value of community surveillance in ameliorating antisocial behavior, and how authors with competing perspectives negotiate their differences.},

Information visualization and visual data mining can help to deal with the flood of information. The advantage of visual data exploration is that the user is directly involved in the data mining process. There are a large number of information visualization techniques that have been developed over the last two decades to support the exploration of large data sets. In this article, we provide an overview of information visualization and visual data mining techniques, and illustrate them using a few examples. We show that an application of information visualization methods provides new ways of analyzing geography -- related data.},

	Abstract = {The paper introduces linked micromap (LM) plots for presenting environmental summaries. The LM template includes parallel sequences of micromap, label, and statistical summary graphics panels with attention paid to perceptual grouping, sorting and linking of the summary components. The applications show LM plots for Omernik Level II Ecoregions. The summarized United States continental data includes USGS digital elevation, 30-year normal precipitation and temperature, and 8 million AVHRR pixels classified into 159 types of land cover. One LM plot uses a line-height glyph to represent all 159 land cover percentages per ecoregion. LM plots represent new visualization methodology that is useful in the data and knowledge based pattern representation and knowledge discovery process. The LM plots focus on providing an orienting overview. The overview provides a starting place for subsequent drilling down to what could otherwise be viewed as an overwhelming mass of data. The overview also provides a starting place to learn about the intellectual structure that lies behind the notion of ecoregions and begins to connect this abstract structure to quantitative methods.},

	Abstract = {A multiple view system uses two or more distinct views to support the investigation of a single conceptual entity. Many such systems exist, ranging from computer-aided design (CAD) systems for chip design that display both the logical structure and the actual geometry of the integrated circuit to overview-plus-detail systems that show both an overview for context and a zoomed-in-view for detail. Designers of these systems must make a variety of design decisions, ranging from determining layout to constructing sophisticated coordination mechanisms. Surprisingly, little work has been done to characterize these systems or to express guidelines for their design. Based on a workshop discussion of multiple views, and based on our own design and implementation experience with these systems, we present eight guidelines for the design of multiple view systems.},

	Abstract = {Geographic profilers have access to a repertoire of strategies for predicting a serial offenders home location. These strategies range in complexity---some involve more calculations to implement than others---and the assumption often made is that more complex strategies will outperform simpler strategies. In the present study, we tested the relationship between the complexity and accuracy of 11 strategies. Data were crime site and home locations of 16 UK residential burglars who had committed 10 or more crimes each. The results indicated that strategy complexity was not positively related to accuracy. This was also found to be the case across tasks that ranged in complexity (where complexity was determined by the number of crimes used to make a prediction). Implications for police policies and procedures, as well as our understanding of human decision-making, are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Obfuscation concerns the practice of deliberately degrading the quality of information in some way, so as to protect the privacy of the individual to whom that information refers. In this paper, we argue that obfuscation is an important technique for protecting an individual's location privacy within a pervasive computing environment. The paper sets out a formal framework within which obfuscated location-based services are defined. This framework provides a computationally efficient mechanism for balancing an individual's need for high-quality information services against that individual's need for location privacy. Negotiation is used to ensure that a location-based service provider receives only the information it needs to know in order to provide a service of satisfactory quality. The results of this work have implications for numerous applications of mobile and location-aware systems, as they provide a new theoretical foundation for addressing the privacy concerns that are acknowledged to be retarding the widespread acceptance and use of location-based services.},

	Abstract = {Internet geolocation technology aims to determine the physical (geographic) location of Internet users and devices. It is currently proposed or in use for a wide variety of purposes, including targeted marketing, restricting digital content sales to authorized jurisdictions, and security applications such as reducing credit card fraud. This raises questions about the veracity of claims of accurate and reliable geolocation. We provide a survey of Internet geolocation technologies with an emphasis on adversarial contexts; that is, we consider how this technology performs against a knowledgeable adversary whose goal is to evade geolocation. We do so by examining first the limitations of existing techniques, and then, from this base, determining how best to evade existing geolocation techniques. We also consider two further geolocation techniques which may be of use even against adversarial targets: (1) the extraction of client IP addresses using functionality introduced in the 1.5 Java API, and (2) the collection of round-trip times using HTTP refreshes. These techniques illustrate that the seemingly straightforward technique of evading geolocation by relaying traffic through a proxy server (or network of proxy servers) is not as straightforward as many end-users might expect. We give a demonstration of this for users of the popular Tor anonymizing network.},

Across four language editions of Wikipedia, however, we find that participation is less local.

	Abstract = {Information Extraction (IE) systems that can exploit the vast source of textual information that is the internet would provide a revolutionary step forward in terms of delivering large volumes of content cheaply and precisely, thus enabling a wide range of new knowledge driven applications and services. However, despite this enormous potential, few IE systems have successfully made the transition from laboratory to commercial application. The reason may be a purely practical oneto build useable, scaleable IE systems requires bringing together a range of different technologies as well as providing clear and reproducible guidelines as to how to collectively configure and deploy those technologies.
This paper is an attempt to address these issues. The paper focuses on two primary goals. Firstly, we show that an information extraction system which is used for real world applications and different domains can be built using some autonomous, corporate components (agents). Such a system has some advanced properties: clear separation to different extraction tasks and steps, portability to multiple application domain, trainability, extensibility, etc. Secondly, we show that machine learning and, in particular, learning in different ways and at different levels, can be used to build practical IE systems. We show that carefully selecting the right machine learning technique for the right task and selective sampling can be used to reduce the human effort required to annotate examples for building such systems.},

	Abstract = {Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia, available in more than 100 languages and comprising over 1 million articles in its English version. If we consider each Wikipedia article as a node and each hyperlink between articles as an arc we have a "Wikigraph", a graph that represents the link structure of Wikipedia. The Wikigraph differs from other Web graphs studied in the literature by the fact that there are explicit timestamps associated with each node's events. This allows us to do a detailed analysis of the Wikipedia evolution over time. In the first part of this study we characterize this evolution in terms of users, editions and articles; in the second part, we depict the temporal evolution of several topological properties of the Wikigraph. The insights obtained from the Wikigraphs can be applied to large Web graphs from which the temporal data is usually not available.},

	Abstract = {To increase its credibility and preserve the trust of its readers. Wikipedia needs to ensure a good quality of its articles. To that end, it is critical for Wikipedia administrators to be aware of contributors' editing activity to monitor vandalism, encourage reliable contributors to work on specific articles, or find mentors for new contributors. In this paper, we present iChase, a novel interactive visualization tool to provide administrators with better awareness of editing activities on Wikipedia. Unlike the currently used visualizations that provide only page-centric information. iChase visualizes the trend of activities for two entity types; articles and contributors. iChase is based on two heatmaps (one for each entity type) synchronized to one timeline. It allows users to interactively explore the history of changes by drilling down into specific articles and contributors, or time points to access the details of the changes. We also present a case study to illustrate how iChase can be used to monitor editing activities of Wikipedia authors, as well as a usability study. We conclude by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of iChase.},

We take a supervised machine learning approach to address the problem using a C4.5 Decision Tree algorithm. The particularity of our approach is that it focuses on both, structure and contextual information.
A semi-automatic approach was conducted for corpus expansion in order to help annotating the dataset with less human effort.
This paper shows that our method can achieve good results (more than 80% in term of F1-measure) despite the heterogeneity of our corpus.},

@article{etzioni2005unsupervised,
	Abstract = {The KnowItAll system aims to automate the tedious process of extracting large collections of facts (e.g., names of scientists or politicians) from the Web in an unsupervised, domain-independent, and scalable manner. The paper presents an overview of KnowItAll's novel architecture and design principles, emphasizing its distinctive ability to extract information without any hand-labeled training examples. In its first major run, KnowItAll extracted over 50,000 class instances, but suggested a challenge: How can we improve KnowItAll's recall and extraction rate without sacrificing precision?
This paper presents three distinct ways to address this challenge and evaluates their performance. Pattern Learning learns domain-specific extraction rules, which enable additional extractions. Subclass Extraction automatically identifies sub-classes in order to boost recall (e.g., ``chemist'' and ``biologist'' are identified as sub-classes of ``scientist''). List Extraction locates lists of class instances, learns a ``wrapper'' for each list, and extracts elements of each list. Since each method bootstraps from KnowItAll's domain-independent methods, the methods also obviate hand-labeled training examples. The paper reports on experiments, focused on building lists of named entities, that measure the relative efficacy of each method and demonstrate their synergy. In concert, our methods gave KnowItAll a 4-fold to 8-fold increase in recall at precision of 0.90, and discovered over 10,000 cities missing from the Tipster Gazetteer.},

- Subclass extraction, e.g. a chemist is a scientist (could be adapted for Berlin is in Germany)
- Pattern Learning, leverage domain specific rulesets

	Abstract = {Blatantly unproductive edits undermine the quality of the collaboratively-edited encyclopedia, Wikipedia. They not only disseminate dishonest and offensive content, but force editors to waste time undoing such acts of vandalism. Language-processing has been applied to combat these malicious edits, but as with email spam, these filters are evadable and computationally complex. Meanwhile, recent research has shown spatial and temporal features effective in mitigating email spam, while being lightweight and robust.

In this paper, we leverage the spatio-temporal properties of revision metadata to detect vandalism on Wikipedia. An administrative form of reversion called rollback enables the tagging of malicious edits, which are contrasted with non-offending edits in numerous dimensions. Crucially, none of these features require inspection of the article or revision text. Ultimately, a classifier is produced which flags vandalism at performance comparable to the natural-language efforts we intend to complement (85% accuracy at 50% recall). The classifier is scalable (processing 100+ edits a second) and has been used to locate over 5,000 manually-confirmed incidents of vandalism outside our labeled set.},

	Abstract = {The rise of the Internet has enabled collaboration and cooperation on anunprecedentedly large scale. The online encyclopedia Wikipedia, which presently comprises 7.2 million articles created by 7.04 million distinct editors, provides a consummate example. We examined all 50 million edits made tothe 1.5 million English-language Wikipedia articles and found that the high-quality articles are distinguished by a marked increase in number of edits, number of editors, and intensity of cooperative behavior, as compared to other articles of similar visibility and age. This is significant because in other domains, fruitful cooperation has proven to be difficult to sustain as the size of the collaboration increases. Furthermore, in spite of the vagaries of human behavior, we show that Wikipedia articles accrete edits according to a simple stochastic mechanism in which edits beget edits. Topics of high interest or relevance are thus naturally brought to the forefront of quality.},

In this paper, we are in particular interested in a certain type of Wikipedia articles, namely, the featured articles - articles marked by a community's vote as being of outstanding quality. The German Wikipedia has the nice property that it has two types of featured articles: excellent and worth reading. We explore on the German Wikipedia whether only the mere number of contributors makes the difference or whether the high quality of featured articles results from having experienced authors contributing with a reputation for high quality contributions. Our results indicate that it does matter who contributes.},

The hyperlinks pointing from one Wikipedia article to another are treated as directed links while the articles represent the nodes of the network. We show that many network characteristics are common to different language versions of Wikipedia, such as their degree distributions, growth, topology, reciprocity, clustering, assortativity, path lengths, and triad significance profiles. These regularities, found in the ensemble of Wikipedias in different languages and of different sizes, point to the existence of a unique growth process. We also compare Wikipedias to other previously studied networks.},

By describing topics by vertices and hyperlinks between them as edges, we can represent this encyclopedia as a directed graph. The topological properties of this graph are in close analogy with those of the World Wide Web, despite the very different growth mechanism. In particular, we measure a scale-invariant distribution of the in and out degree and we are able to reproduce these features by means of a simple statistical model. As a major consequence, Wikipedia growth can be described by local rules such as the preferential attachment mechanism, though users, who are responsible of its evolution, can act globally on the network.},

	Abstract = {Recently, Nature published an article comparing the quality of Wikipedia articles to those of Encyclopedia Britannica (Giles 2005). The article, which gained much public attention, provides evidence for Wikipedia quality, but does not provide an explanation of the underlying source of that quality. Wikipedia, and wikis in general, aggregate information from a large and diverse author-base, where authors are free to modify any article. Building upon Surowiecki's (2005) Wisdom of Crowds, we develop a model of the factors that determine wiki content quality. In an empirical study of Wikipedia, we find strong support for our model. Our results indicate that increasing size and diversity of the author-base improves content quality. We conclude by highlighting implications for system design and suggesting avenues for future research.},

We cross-correlate multiple Wikipedia traffic data sets to infer various behavioral features of its users: their usage patterns (e.g., as a reference or a source); their motivations (e.g., routine tasks such as student homework vs. information needs dictated by news events); their search strategies (how and to what extent accessing an article leads to further related readings inside or outside Wikipedia); and what determines their choice of Wikipedia as an information resource. We primarily study article hit counts to determine how the popularity of articles (and article categories) changes over time, and in response to news events in the English-speaking world. We further leverage logs of actual navigational patterns from a very large sample of Indiana University users over a period of one year, allowing us unprecedented ability to study how users traverse an online encyclopedia. This data allows us to make quantitative claims about how users choose links when navigating Wikipedia. From this same source of data we are further able to extract analogous navigation networks representing other large sites, including Facebook, to compare and contrast the use of these sites with Wikipedia. Finally we present a possible application of traffic analysis to page categorization.},

	Abstract = {Wikipedia has been built to gather encyclopedic knowledge using a collaborative social process that has proved its effectiveness. However, the workload required for raising the quality and increasing the coverage of Wikipedia is exhausting the community. Based on several participatory design sessions with active Wikipedia contributors (a.k.a. Wikipedians), we have collected a set of measures related to Wikipedia activity that, if available and visualized effectively, could spare a lot of monitoring time to these Wikipedians, allowing them to focus on quality and coverage of Wikipedia instead of spending their time navigating heavily to track vandals and copyright infringements. However, most of these measures cannot be computed on the fly using the available Wikipedia API. Therefore, we have designed an open architecture called WikiReactive to compute incrementally and maintain several aggregated measures on the French Wikipedia. This aggregated data is available as a Web Service and can be used to overlay information on Wikipedia articles through Wikipedia Skins or for new services for Wikipedians or people studying Wikipedia. This article describes the architecture, its performance and some of its uses.},

	Abstract = {Wikipedia has grown to be the world largest and busiest free encyclopedia, in which articles are collaboratively written and maintained by volunteers online. Despite its success as a means of knowledge sharing and collaboration, the public has never stopped criticizing the quality of Wikipedia articles edited by non-experts and inexperienced contributors. In this paper, we investigate the problem of assessing the quality of articles in collaborative authoring of Wikipedia. We propose three article quality measurement models that make use of the interaction data between articles and their contributors derived from the article edit history. Our Basic model is designed based on the mutual dependency between article quality and their author authority. The PeerReview model introduces the review behavior into measuring article quality. Finally, our ProbReview models extend PeerReview with partial reviewership of contributors as they edit various portions of the articles. We conduct experiments on a set of well-labeled Wikipedia articles to evaluate the effectiveness of our quality measurement models in resembling human judgement.},

	Abstract = {Wikipedia 1 is a very large and successful Web 2.0 example. As the number of Wikipedia articles and contributors grows at a very fast pace, there are also increasing disputes occurring among the contributors. Disputes often happen in articles with controversial content. They also occur frequently among contributors who are "aggressive" or controversial in their personalities. In this paper, we aim to identify controversial articles in Wikipedia. We propose three models, namely the Basic model and two Controversy Rank (CR) models. These models draw clues from collaboration and edit history instead of interpreting the actual articles or edited content. While the Basic model only considers the amount of disputes within an article, the two Controversy Rank models extend the former by considering the relationships between articles and contributors. We also derived enhanced versions of these models by considering the age of articles. Our experiments on a collection of 19,456 Wikipedia articles shows that the Controversy Rank models can more effectively determine controversial articles compared to the Basic and other baseline models.},

Every edge in the tree is given a weight, called adoption coefficient, indicating similarity between the two corresponding page versions. The same coefficients are used to build the tree. In the implementation described, adoption coefficients are derived from comparing texts of the versions, similarly to computing edit distance. The tree structure reflects actual evolution of page content, revealing reverts, vandalism, and edit wars, which is demonstrated on Wikipedia examples. The tree representation is useful for both human editors and automated algorithms, including trust and reputation schemes for wiki.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel visualization tool known as WikiNetViz to visualize and analyze disputes among users in a dispute-induced social network. WikiNetViz is designed to quantify the degree of dispute between a pair of users using the article history. Each user (and article) is also assigned a controversy score by our proposed controversy rank model so as to measure the degree of controversy of a user (and an article) by the amount of disputes between the user (article) and other users in articles of varying degrees of controversy. On the constructed social network, WikiNetViz can perform clustering so as to visualize the dynamics of disputes at the user group level. It also provides an article viewer for examining an article revision so as to determine the article content modified by different users.},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of measuring user contributions to versioned, collaborative bodies of information, such as wikis. Measuring the contributions of individual authors can be used to divide revenue, to recognize merit, to award status promotions, and to choose the order of authors when citing the content. In the context of the Wikipedia, previous works on author contribution estimation have focused on two criteria: the total text created, and the total number of edits performed. We show that neither of these criteria work well: both techniques are vulnerable to manipulation, and the total-text criterion fails to reward people who polish or re-arrange the content.

We consider and compare various alternative criteria that take into account the quality of a contribution, in addition to the quantity, and we analyze how the criteria differ in the way they rank authors according to their contributions. As an outcome of this study, we propose to adopt total edit longevity as a measure of author contribution. Edit longevity is resistant to simple attacks, since edits are counted towards an author's contribution only if other authors accept the contribution. Edit longevity equally rewards people who create content, and people who rearrange or polish the content. Finally, edit longevity distinguishes the people who contribute little (who have contribution close to zero) from spammers or vandals, whose contribution quickly grows negative.},

For instance, how equal (or unequal) are the contributions to it has been discussed in the last years, with no conclusive results. In this paper, we study exactly that aspect by using Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients, very well known instruments to economists. We analyze the trends in the inequality of distributions for the ten biggest language editions of Wikipedia, and their evolution over time. As a result, we have found large differences in the number of contributions by different authors (something also observed in free, open source software development), and a trend to stable patterns of inequality in the long run.},

	Abstract = {The problem of identifying useful and trustworthy information on the World Wide Web is becoming increasingly acute as new tools such as wikis and blogs simplify and democratize publication. It is not hard to predict that in the future the direct reliance on this material will expand and the problem of evaluating the trustworthiness of this kind of content become crucial. The Wikipedia project represents the most successful and discussed example of such online resources. In this paper we present a method to predict Wikipedia articles trustworthiness based on computational trust techniques and a deep domain-specific analysis. Our assumption is that a deeper understanding of what in general defines high-standard and expertise in domains related to Wikipedia -- i.e. content quality in a collaborative environment -- mapped onto Wikipedia elements would lead to a complete set of mechanisms to sustain trust in Wikipedia context. We present a series of experiment. The first is a study-case over a specific category of articles; the second is an evaluation over 8 000 articles representing 65% of the overall Wikipedia editing activity. We report encouraging results on the automated evaluation of Wikipedia content using our domain-specific expertise method. Finally, in order to appraise the value added by using domain-specific expertise, we compare our results with the ones obtained with a pre-processed cluster analysis, where complex expertise is mostly replaced by training and automatic classification of common features.},

	Abstract = {We present results of a new approach to detect destructive article revisions, so-called vandalism, in Wikipedia. Vandalism detection is a one-class classification problem, where vandalism edits are the target to be identified among all revisions. Interestingly, vandalism detection has not been addressed in the Information Retrieval literature by now. In this paper we discuss the characteristics of vandalism as humans recognize it and develop features to render vandalism detection as a machine learning task. We compiled a large number of vandalism edits in a corpus, which allows for the comparison of existing and new detection approaches. Using logistic regression we achieve 83% precision at 77% recall with our model. Compared to the rule-based methods that are currently applied in Wikipedia, our approach increases the F-Measure performance by 49% while being faster at the same time.},

@article{coleman2009volunteered,
	Abstract = {Advances in positioning, Web mapping, cellular communications and wiki technologies have outpaced the original visions of GSDI programs around the world. By tapping the distributed knowledge, personal time and energy of volunteer contributors, GI voluntarism is beginning to relocate and redistribute selected GI productive activities from mapping agencies to networks of non-state volunteer actors. Participants in the production process are both users and producers, or `produsers' to use a recent neologism. Indeed, GI voluntarism ultimately has the potential to redistribute the rights to define and judge the value of the produced geographic information and of the new production system in general.	The concept and its implementation presents a rich collection of both opportunities and risks now being considered by leaders of public and private mapping organizations world-wide. In this paper, the authors describe and classify both the types of people who volunteer geospatial information and the nature of their contributions. Combining empirical research dealing with the Open Source software and Wikipedia communities with input from selected national mapping agencies and private companies, the authors propose a taxonomy of voluntary geospatial information contributors. Differentiating between three different contexts in which these volunteer contributors operate -- market-driven, social networking, and civic/governmental -- the authors describe key opportunities, constraints and factors to consider in each case when determining whether and how to assess information provided by such sources.},

Among the more significant changes is the increasing amount of readily available volunteered geographic information. Although volunteered information has fundamentally enhanced geographic data, it has also prompted concerns with regard to its quality, reliability, and overall value. This essay situates these concerns as issues of information and source credibility by (a) examining the information environment fostering collective information contribution, (b) exploring the environment of information abundance, examining credibility and related notions within this environment, and leveraging extant research findings to understand user-generated geographic information, (c) articulating strategies to discern the credibility of volunteered geographic information (VGI), including relevant tools useful in this endeavor, and (d) outlining specific research questions germane to VGI and credibility.},

	Abstract = {Volunteered geographic information (VGI) refers to the geographic subset of online user-generated content. Through Geobrowsers and online mapping services, which use geovisualization and Web technologies to share and produce VGI, a global digital commons of geographic information has emerged. A notable example is Wikipedia, an online collaborative encyclopedia where anyone can edit articles, including those about place. Wikipedia's editorial transparency and integration with online mapping services make it well suited for studying VGI production.

My dissertation contributes empirical evidence and quantitative methods to an emerging area of study--the efficacy and use of VGI--and I focus on spatial behavior in VGI production, which is largely unknown. In particular, the capacity of a ubiquitous Internet to reduce communication costs has raised questions of whether geographic distance matters in information and economic production. My research tests whether proximity matters in VGI production. That is, do VGI contributors write about nearby places? Moreover, what are suitable research methods to study large-scale VGI system with millions of contributors like Wikipedia?

For my study, I collect a corpus of 32 million contributions to 1 million geotagged Wikipedia articles over 7 years (2001-2008). I use data mining and IP geolocation methods on the corpus to select a sample dataset that includes 7.3 million contributions by 2.8 million anonymous contributors to 0.4 million geotagged articles in 21 languages. To measure the proximity effect between articles and contributors, I develop a "signature distance" metric, which is a weighted average of distances between author and article. To model spatial interaction behaviors of contributors, I use a probabilistic invariant gravity model with an exponential distance decay function. My primary findings indicate that anonymous contributors write about nearby places, and that the influence of proximity decays exponentially and varies categorically.},

@article{ortega2009wikipedia,
	Abstract = {In this doctoral thesis, we undertake a quantitative analysis of the top-ten language editions
of Wikipedia, from different perspectives. Our main goal has been to trace the evolution in time
of key descriptive and organizational parameters of Wikipedia and its community of authors. The
analysis has focused on logged authors (those editors who created a personal account to participate
in the project). Among the distinct metrics included, we can find the monthly evolution of general
metrics (number of revisions, active editors, active pages); the distribution of pages and its length,
the evolution of participation in discussion pages. We also present a detailed analysis of the
inner social structure and stratification of the Wikipedia community of logged authors, fitting
appropriate distributions to the most relevant metrics. We also examine the inequality level of
contributions from logged authors, showing that there exists a core of very active authors who
undertake most of the editorial work. Regarding articles, the inequality analysis also shows that
there exists a reduced group of popular articles, though the distribution of revisions is not as
skewed as in the previous case. The analysis continues with an in-depth demographic study
of the community of authors, focusing on the evolution of the core of very active contributors
(applying a statistical technique known as survival analysis). We also explore some basic metrics
to analyze the quality of Wikipedia articles and the trustworthiness level of individual authors.
This work concludes with an extended analysis of the evolution of the most influential parameters
and metrics previously presented.
Based on these metrics, we infer important conclusions about the future sustainability of
Wikipedia. According to these results, the Wikipedia community of authors has ceased to grow,
remaining stable since Summer 2006 until the end of 2007. As a result, the monthly number of
revisions has remained stable over the same period, restricting the number of articles that can be
reviewed by the community. On the other side, whilst the number of revisions in talk pages has
stabilized over the same period, as well, the number of active talk pages follows a steady growing
rate, for all versions. This suggests that the community of authors is shifting its focus to broaden
the coverage of discussion pages, which has a direct impact in the final quality of content, as
previous research works has shown.
Regarding the inner social structure of the Wikipedia community of logged authors, we find
Pareto-like distributions that fit all relevant metrics pertaining authors (number of revisions per
author, number of different articles edited per author), while measurements on articles (number
of revisions per article, number of different authors per article) follow lognormal shapes. The
analysis of the inequality level of revisions performed by authors, and revisions received by articles
shows highly unequal distributions. The results of our survival analysis onWikipedia authors
presents very high mortality percentages on young authors, revealing an endemic problem of
Wikipedias to keep young editors on collaborating with the project for a long period of time. In
the same way, from our survival analysis we obtain that the mean lifetime of Wikipedia authors
in the core (until they abandon the group of top editors) is situated between 200 and 400 days, for all versions, while the median value is lower than 120 days in all cases. Moreover the analysis
of the monthly number of births and deaths in the community of logged authors reveals that the
cause of the shift in the monthly trend of active authors is produced by a higher number of deaths
from Summer 2006 in all versions, surpassing the monthly number of births from then on.
The analysis of the inequality level of contributions over time, and the evolution of additional
key features identified in this thesis, reveals a worrying trend towards progressive increase of
the effort spent by core authors, as time elapses. This trend may eventually cause that these
authors will reach their upper limit in the number of revisions they can perform each month, thus
starting a decreasing trend in the number of monthly revisions, and an overall recession of the
content creation and reviewing process in Wikipedia. To prevent this probable future scenario,
the number of monthly new editors should be improved again, perhaps through the adoption of
specific policies and campaigns for attracting new editors to Wikipedia, and recover older topcontributors
again.
Finally, another important contribution for the research community is WikiXRay, the software
tool we have developed to perform the statistical analyses included in this thesis. This tool
completely automates the process of retrieving the database dumps from the Wikimedia public
repositories, process them to obtain key metrics and descriptive parameters, and load them in a
local database, ready to be used in empirical analyses.
As far as we know, this is the first research work implementing a comparative analysis, from an
quantitative point of view, of the top-ten language editions of Wikipedia, presenting results from
many different scientific perspectives. Therefore, we expect that this contribution will help the
scientific community to enhance their understanding of the rich, complex and fascinating working
mechanisms and behavioral patterns of the Wikipedia project and its community of authors.
Likewise, we hope that WikiXRay will facilitate the hard task of developing empirical analyses
on any language version of the encyclopedia, boosting in this way the number of comparative
studies like this one in many other scientific disciplines.},

@article{luyt2008improving,
	Abstract = {Wikipedia is fast becoming a key information source for many despite criticism that it is unreliable and inaccurate. A number of recommendations have been made to sort the chaff from the wheat in Wikipedia, among which is the idea of color-coding article segment edits according to age (Cross, 2006). Using data collected as part of a wider study published in Nature, this article examines the distribution of errors throughout the life of a select group of Wikipedia articles. The survival time of each ``error edit'' in terms of the edit counts and days was calculated and the hypothesis that surviving material added by older edits is more trustworthy was tested. Surprisingly, we find that roughly 20% of errors can be attributed to surviving text added by the first edit, which confirmed the existence of a ``first-mover'' effect (Viegas, Wattenberg, & Kushal, 2004) whereby material added by early edits are less likely to be removed. We suggest that the sizable number of errors added by early edits is simply a result of more material being added near the beginning of the life of the article. Overall, the results do not provide support for the idea of trusting surviving segments attributed to older edits because such edits tend to add more material and hence contain more errors which do not seem to be offset by greater opportunities for error correction by later edits.},

Wikipedia is the most extraordinary example of this phenomenon and, although a few mechanisms have been put in place to improve contributions quality, trust in Wikipedia content quality has been seriously questioned. We thought that a deeper understanding of what in general defines high-standard and expertise in domains related to Wikipedia -- i.e. content quality in a collaborative environment -- mapped onto Wikipedia elements would lead to a complete set of mechanisms to sustain trust in Wikipedia context. Our evaluation, conducted on about 8,000 articles representing 65% of the overall Wikipedia editing activity, shows that the new trust evidence that we extracted from Wikipedia allows us to transparently and automatically compute trust values to isolate articles of great or low quality.},

	Abstract = {Wikis are designed to support collaborative editing, without focusing on individual contribution, such that it is not straightforward to determine who contributed to a specific page. However, as wikis are increasingly adopted in settings such as business, government, and education, where editors are largely driven by career goals, there is a perceived need to modify wikis so that each editor's contributions are clearly presented. In this paper we introduce an approach for assessing the contributions of wiki editors along several authorship categories, as well as a variety of information glyphs for visualizing this information. We report on three types of analysis: (a) assessing the accuracy of the algorithms, (b) estimating the understandability of the visualizations, and (c) exploring wiki editors' perceptions regarding the extent to which such an approach is likely to change their behavior. Our findings demonstrate that our proposed automated techniques can estimate fairly accurately the quantity of editors' contributions across various authorship categories, and that the visualizations we introduced can clearly convey this information to users. Moreover, our user study suggests that such tools are likely to change wiki editors' behavior. We discuss both the potential benefits and risks associated with solutions for estimating and visualizing wiki contributions.},

As exemplified in Wikipedia, online collaborative information repositories are being generated, updated, and maintained by a large and diverse community of users. Issues concerning trust arise when content is generated and updated by diverse populations. Since these information repositories are constantly under revision, trust determination is not simply a static process. In this paper, we explore ways of utilizing the revision history of an article to assess the trustworthiness of the article. We then present an experiment where we used this revision history-based trust model to assess the trustworthiness of a chain of successive versions of articles in Wikipedia and evaluated the assessments produced by the model.},

Two of these types of applications -- collaborative workspaces and social network sites -- have a number of features in common, which are explored to provide a basis for comparative analysis. This basis is extended with a suitable definition of privacy, a sociological perspective and an applicable adversary model in order to facilitate an investigation of similarities and differences with regard to privacy threats. Practical examples are derived from the use of Wikipedia and Facebook. Analysis suggests that a combination of technical, legal, and normative solutions should be considered to counter privacy issues.

	Abstract = {One important innovation in information and communication technology developed over the past decade was organizational rather than merely technological. Open source production is remarkable because it converts a private commodity (typically software) into a public good. A number of studies examine the factors motivating contributions to open source production goods, but we argue it is important to understand the causes of high quality contributions to such goods. In this paper, we analyze quality in the open source online encyclopedia Wikipedia. We find that, for users who create an online persona through a registered user name, the quality of contributions increases as the number of contributions increase, consistent with the idea of experts motivated by reputation and committed to the Wikipedia community. Unexpectedly, however, we find the highest quality contributions come from the vast numbers of anonymous ``Good Samaritans'' who contribute infrequently. Our findings that Good Samaritans as well as committed ``Zealots'' contribute high quality content to Wikipedia suggest that open source production is remarkable as much for its organizational as its technological innovation that enables vast numbers of anonymous one-time contributors to create high quality, essentially public goods.},

	Abstract = {Many activities of editors in Wikipedia can be traced using its database dumps, 
which register detailed information about every single change to every article. 
Several researchers have used this information to gain knowledge about the 
production process of articles, and about activity patterns of authors. In this 
analysis, we have focused onone of those previous works, by Kittur et al. 
First, we have followed the same methodology with more recent and 
comprehensive data. Then, we have extended this methodology to precisely 
identify which fraction of authors are producing most of the changes in 
Wikipedia's articles, and how the behaviour of these authors evolves over time. 
This enabled us not only to validate some of the previous results, but also to 
find new interesting evidences. We have found that the analysis of sysops is 
not a good method for estimating different levels of contributions, since it is 
dependent on the policy for electing them (which changes over time and for 
each language). Moreover, we have found new activity patterns classifying 
authors by their contributions during specific periods of time, instead of using 
their total number of contributions over the whole life of Wikipedia. Finally, we 
present a tool that automates this extended methodology, implementing a 
quick and complete quantitative analysis of every language edition in Wikipedia.},

To analyze the huge edit histories of the site's administrators we introduce a visualization technique, the chromogram, that can display very long textual sequences through a simple color coding scheme. Using chromograms we describe a set of characteristic editing patterns. In addition to confirming known patterns, such reacting to vandalism events, we identify a distinct class of organized systematic activities. We discuss how both reactive and systematic strategies shed light on self-allocation of effort in Wikipedia, and how they may pertain to other peer-production systems.},

A remarkable property of some Wikipedia pages is that they are written by up to thousands of authors who may have contradicting opinions.

We propose a set of analysis and visualization techniques that reveal the dominant authors of a page, the roles they play, and the alters they confront. Thereby we provide tools to understand how Wikipedia authors collaborate in the presence of controversy.},

	Abstract = {The online encyclopedia Wikipedia is a highly successful ``open content'' project, written and maintained completely by volunteers. Little is known, however, about the motivation of these volunteers. Results from an online survey among 106 contributors to the German Wikipedia project are presented. Both motives derived from social sciences (perceived benefits, identification with Wikipedia, etc.) as well as perceived task characteristics (autonomy, skill variety, etc.) were assessed as potential predictors of contributors' satisfaction and self-reported engagement. Satisfaction ratings were particularly determined by perceived benefits, identification with the Wikipedia community, and task characteristics. Engagement was particularly determined by high tolerance for opportunity costs and by task characteristics, the latter effect being partially mediated by intrinsic motivation. Relevant task characteristics for contributors' engagement and satisfaction were perceived autonomy, task significance, skill variety, and feedback. Models from social sciences and work psychology complemented each other by suggesting that favorable task experiences might counter perceived opportunity costs in Wikipedia contributors. Moreover, additional data reported by Wikipedia authors indicate the importance of generativity motives.},

However, this mutability also leads many to distrust it as a reliable source of information. Although there have been many attempts at developing metrics to help users judge the trustworthiness of content, it is unknown how much impact such measures can have on a system that is perceived as inherently unstable. Here we examine whether a visualization that exposes hidden article information can impact readers' perceptions of trustworthiness in a wiki environment. Our results suggest that surfacing information relevant to the stability of the article and the patterns of editor behavior can have a significant impact on users' trust across a variety of page types.},

	Abstract = {Wikis are popular tools commonly used to support distributed collaborative work. Wikis can be seen as virtual scrap-books that anyone can edit without having any specific technical know-how. The Wikipedia is a flagship example of a real-word application of wikis. Due to the large scale of Wikipedia it's difficult to easily grasp much of the information that is stored in this wiki. We address one particular aspect of this issue by looking at the revision history of each article. Plotting the revision activity in a timeline we expose the complete article's history in a easily understandable format. We present WikiChanges, a web-based application designed to plot an article's revision timeline in real time. WikiChanges also includes a web browser extension that incorporates activity sparklines in the real Wikipedia. Finally, we introduce a revisions summarization task that addresses the need to understand what occurred during a given set of revisions. We present a first approach to this task using tag clouds to present the revisions made.},

	Abstract = {Information networks in Wikipedia evolve as users collaboratively edit articles that embed the networks. These information networks represent both the structure and content of community's knowledge and the networks evolve as the knowledge gets updated. By observing the networks evolve and finding their evolving patterns, one can gain higher order knowledge about the networks and conduct longitudinal network analysis to detect events and summarize trends. In this paper, we present SSNetViz+, a visual analytic tool to support visualization and exploration of Wikipedia's information networks. SSNetViz+ supports time-based network browsing, content browsing and search. Using a terrorism information network as an example, we show that different timestamped versions of the network can be interactively explored. As information networks in Wikipedia are created and maintained by collaborative editing efforts, the edit activity data are also shown to help detecting interesting events that may have happened to the network. SSNetViz+ also supports temporal queries that allow other relevant nodes to be added so as to expand the network being analyzed.},

	Abstract = {Collaborative writing through wikis has become increasingly popular in recent years. When users contribute to a wiki article they implicitly establish a co-authorship relationship. Discovering these relationships can be of value, for example in finding experts on a given topic. However, it is not trivial to determine the main co-authors for a given author among the potentially thousands who have contributed to a given author's edit history. We have developed a method and algorithm for calculating a co-authorship degree for a given pair of authors. We have implemented this method as an extension for the MediaWiki system and demonstrate its performance which is satisfactory in the majority of cases. This paper also presents a method of determining an expertise group for a chosen topic.},

	Abstract = {Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia which has undergone tremendous growth. However, this same growth has made it difficult to characterize its content and coverage. In this paper we develop measures to map Wikipedia using its socially annotated, hierarchical category structure. We introduce a mapping technique that takes advantage of socially-annotated hierarchical categories while dealing with the inconsistencies and noise inherent in the distributed way that they are generated. The technique is demonstrated through two applications: mapping the distribution of topics in Wikipedia and how they have changed over time; and mapping the degree of conflict found in each topic area. We also discuss the utility of the approach for other applications and datasets involving collaboratively annotated category hierarchies.},

We use the articles in the categories (to depth three) of Physics and Philosophy and extract and focus on significant editors (at least 7 or 10 edits per each article). We construct a bipartite network, and from it, overlapping cliques of densely connected articles and editors. We cluster these densely connected cliques into larger modules to study examples of larger groups that display how volunteer editors flock around articles driven by interest, real-world controversies, or the result of coordination in WikiProjects. Our results confirm that topics aggregate editors; and show that highly coordinated efforts result in dense clusters.},

	Abstract = {We present a content-driven reputation system for Wikipedia authors. In our system, authors gain reputation when the edits they perform to Wikipedia articles are preserved by subsequent authors, and they lose reputation when their edits are rolled back or undone in short order. Thus, author reputation is computed solely on the basis of content evolution; user-to-user comments or ratings are not used. The author reputation we compute could be used to flag new contributions from low-reputation authors, or it could be used to allow only authors with high reputation to contribute to controversialor critical pages. A reputation system for the Wikipedia could also provide an incentive for high-quality contributions. We have implemented the proposed system, and we have used it to analyze the entire Italian and French Wikipedias, consisting of a total of 691, 551 pages and 5, 587, 523 revisions. Our results show that our notion of reputation has good predictive value: changes performed by low-reputation authors have a significantly larger than average probability of having poor quality, as judged by human observers, and of being later undone, as measured by our algorithms.},

	Abstract = {The Wikipedia is a collaborative encyclopedia: anyone can contribute to its articles simply by clicking on an "edit" button. The open nature of the Wikipedia has been key to its success, but has also created a challenge: how can readers develop an informed opinion on its reliability? We propose a system that computes quantitative values of trust for the text in Wikipedia articles; these trust values provide an indication of text reliability.

The system uses as input the revision history of each article, as well as information about the reputation of the contributing authors, as provided by a reputation system. The trust of a word in an article is computed on the basis of the reputation of the original author of the word, as well as the reputation of all authors who edited text near the word. The algorithm computes word trust values that vary smoothly across the text; the trust values can be visualized using varying text-background colors. The algorithm ensures that all changes to an article's text are reflected in the trust values, preventing surreptitious content changes.

We have implemented the proposed system, and we have used it to compute and display the trust of the text of thousands of articles of the English Wikipedia. To validate our trust-computation algorithms, we show that text labeled as low-trust has a significantly higher probability of being edited in the future than text labeled as high-trust.},

It is difficult for them to determine how long the text in a page has existed, or who originally authored the text. It is also difficult to assess the reliability of authors contributing to a wiki page. In this paper, we create a set of trust indicators and metrics derived from phrasal analysis of the article revision history. These metrics include author attribution, author reputation, expertise ratings, article evolution, and text trustworthiness. We also propose a new technique for collecting and maintaining explicit article ratings across multiple revisions.},

	Abstract = {Whether knowingly or otherwise, Wikipedia contributors reveal their interests and expertise through their contribution patterns. An analysis of Wikipedia edit histories shows that it is often possible to associate contributors with relatively small geographic regions, usually corresponding to where they were born or where they presently live. For many contributors, the geographic coordinates of pages they have edited are tightly clustered. Results suggest that a wealth of information about contributors can be gleaned from edit histories. This illustrates the efficacy of data mining on large, publicly-available datasets and raises potential privacy concerns.},
