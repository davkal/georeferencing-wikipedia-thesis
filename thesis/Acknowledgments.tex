\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

Above all, I would like to thank my mother for all her loving care over the course of my studies, for her unrelenting proofreading, and for all the shirts she will ever iron.
I thank both my dad and my grandmother for instilling in my heart an insatiable appetite for the exploration of knowledge. 

I am most grateful to my supervisor, Claudia, and the support and patience she has shown.
I would also like to thank Molly Hannon and Peter Bourgon for all their input and rigorous views on copy-editing.

This thesis would not have been possible without the moral support of Beeke Urban, Lena Boers, and S\"ohnke Vosgerau, who kept me company during countless hours of studying.
Many thanks also go to Andreas Heumann, Beata Biel, Dumisani Tekile, Liisi Sukles, Markus D\"uttmann, Sebastian Nehmsch, and Thomas Shuster, for taking my mind off this thesis once in a while,  whereever they were located.
